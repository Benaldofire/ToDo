## Notes

Had some challenges implementing a second activity screen which allows users to edit their Todo list. 
The main issue was that the android method startActivityForResult had deprecated and when I used alternate methods, it resulted in my app crashing
After hours of trying to figure out a way to make it work, I had no choice but to temporarily let go of the idea and find out a better way to overcome the issue.
